## Data Flow Explanation

The application follows a top-down data flow pattern.

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. `Board` manages all Kanban columns.
2. `Board` passes column information to each `Column`.
3. `Column` renders task content using the `children` prop.
4. `TaskCard` receives task data and displays task information.
5. `PriorityBadge` receives the task priority and applies the correct styling.

This separation ensures:
- Clean architecture
- Better scalability
- Easier debugging
- Improved maintainability

---

## Example Data Flow Scenario

```txt
Board
 → Column ("To Do")
    → TaskCard ("Implement Authentication")
       → PriorityBadge ("High")
```

### Scenario Description

- The `Board` component renders multiple workflow columns.
- A column titled `"To Do"` contains pending tasks.
- The `TaskCard` displays task details such as:
  - title
  - description
  - assignee
  - priority
- `PriorityBadge` determines the correct visual indicator.

Example:
- High priority → red badge
- Medium priority → yellow badge
- Low priority → green badge

This layered approach keeps business logic separated from UI presentation.

# Design Decisions

## Why use reusable components?

Reusable components:
- reduce duplicate code
- improve consistency
- simplify maintenance
- improve scalability

This architecture allows components to be reused across multiple pages and features.

---

## Why use children prop in Column?

The `children` prop allows the `Column` component to remain flexible.

Benefits:
- Decouples Column from TaskCard
- Supports rendering different content types
- Improves scalability
- Follows React composition principles

Without `children`, Column would become tightly coupled to a specific task implementation.

---

## Why separate PriorityBadge?

Separating `PriorityBadge` improves:
- reusability
- readability
- maintainability

Benefits:
- centralized priority styling
- cleaner TaskCard component
- easier future updates

Example:
If priority colors change later, updates only happen in one component.

---

## Why use TypeScript interfaces?

TypeScript interfaces improve:
- type safety
- autocomplete
- developer experience
- maintainability

Benefits in this project:
- prevents invalid data structures
- ensures consistent props
- reduces runtime bugs

This becomes increasingly important as applications grow larger.

---

## Why use Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS was selected because it:
- speeds up development
- reduces custom CSS files
- improves consistency
- supports responsive design easily

Utility-first styling also simplifies maintenance.

---

## Server vs Client Components

Next.js App Router supports:
- Server Components
- Client Components

---

### Server Components

Server components render on the server and improve:
- performance
- SEO
- initial page load speed

Examples:
- `Board.tsx`
- `PriorityBadge.tsx`
- `DeveloperProfile.tsx`

These components mainly display UI without browser interaction.

---

### Client Components

Client components are required for:
- click handlers
- browser interactivity
- React hooks
- local state management

Client components use:

```tsx
"use client";
```

Examples:
- `Button.tsx`
- `Column.tsx`

These handle:
- loading states
- button interactions
- add task actions

---

## Why separate server and client components?

Benefits:
- smaller client bundles
- improved performance
- faster rendering
- better scalability

This creates an optimized balance between:
- interactivity
- performance
- maintainability

---

# Type Definitions

## Priority Type

```ts
export type Priority = "low" | "medium" | "high";
```

### Purpose

Defines available task priority levels.

---

## Task Type

```ts
export interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  priority: Priority;
  columnId: string;

  assignee?: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    avatar?: string;
  };

  dueDate?: string;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### Purpose

Represents a task inside the Kanban workflow.

### Key Features

- optional description
- optional assignee
- typed priority system
- creation timestamps

---

## Column Type

```ts
export interface Column {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  color: string;
  taskIds: string[];
}
```

### Purpose

Represents a Kanban workflow column.

### Example Columns

- To Do
- In Progress
- Done

---

# Scalability Considerations

The architecture was designed to support future enhancements such as:
- drag and drop
- API integration
- authentication
- task filtering
- search
- real-time collaboration

The modular structure ensures future features can be added with minimal refactoring.

---

# Conclusion

This project follows a scalable and maintainable frontend architecture using modern React and Next.js practices.

Core architectural principles:
- reusable components
- separation of concerns
- top-down data flow
- type safety
- modular organization

The documentation is designed to help new developers quickly understand:
- component relationships
- data flow
- design decisions
- project structure
# Client vs Server Component Examples

## Example: Server Component

```tsx
import PriorityBadge from "@/components/PriorityBadge";

const TaskPreview = () => {
  return <PriorityBadge priority="high" />;
};

export default TaskPreview;
```

### Why Server Component?

This component:
- does not use hooks
- does not manage browser state
- does not handle user interaction

Benefits:
- smaller JavaScript bundle
- faster rendering
- improved SEO

---

## Example: Client Component

```tsx
"use client";

import Button from "@/components/Button";

const AddTaskButton = () => {
  return (
    <Button onClick={() => alert("Task Added")}>
      Add Task
    </Button>
  );
};

export default AddTaskButton;
```

### Why Client Component?

This component requires:
- click handling
- browser interaction
- client-side execution

Client components are only used when interactivity is necessary.

---

# Future Architectural Considerations

## Potential Future Improvements

The current architecture was designed to support future scalability.

Possible future enhancements:
- Drag and Drop support
- API integration
- Real-time collaboration
- Authentication and authorization
- State management with Zustand or Redux
- Database integration
- Task filtering and search

---

## Potential Challenges

As the application grows, some architectural challenges may appear:

### Prop Drilling

Passing data through many nested components can become difficult to manage.

Possible solution:
- React Context
- Zustand
- Redux Toolkit

---

### Large Client Bundles

Too many client components can negatively impact performance.

Current strategy:
- Keep components server-side by default
- Use `"use client"` only when necessary

---

### Scalability of Task State

Managing tasks locally becomes difficult as features increase.

Future solution:
- centralized state management
- API-driven architecture
